# SOCIAL MEDIA USER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## DBMS Project

A social media service focuses on building and maintaining social media communities of people
who share similar interests. Most social media services are web-based and provide a variety of
ways in which users can interact with each other. These include sharing pictures, liking and
commenting and messaging. 
<br>
<ul>
<li> Each user will have personal details such as name, email address,
mobile number, date of birth, password, location etc. Each user will have interactions on social
media in the form of friends, pages and groups joined, liked and disliked posts, comments
posted, etc. 
<li> The database will contain all the personal information and every interaction that the
user has with other users on the app. 
  <li> The existing systems which use simple databases are not
efficient especially in storing photo albums, communities, file attachments etc. 
    </ul> <br>
These are important aspects of social media applications so the use of relational database management
system such as MySQL will help in storing data more efficiently.
